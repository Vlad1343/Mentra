## 💡 Core Features

### 🗣️ AI Interview Practice

- Practice interviews across six professional domains: **Technical, Data Science, Product, Marketing, Sales, and HR**.

<!-- ### 🧑‍🎓 Avatar Personalities

  - **Alex (Challenger)** – Demanding and assertive  
  - **Sam (Supporter)** – Friendly and encouraging  
  - **Jordan (Neutral)** – Balanced and professional  
  - **Casey (Conversational)** – Relaxed and casual  
- Personality affects question tone, follow-ups, and feedback style. -->

### 🎮 Gamification System

- Earn **XP, badges, and streaks** through consistent practice.  
- Level up with visual celebrations and confetti animations.  
- Review past performance via local progress tracking.

### 🔒 Privacy by Design

- **Audio never leaves the browser.**

- Fully compliant with **GDPR Article 25 (Privacy by Design)**.
